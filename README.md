# Discord Custom Rich Presence HOW TO:

To get the custom rich presence client working, you're going to have to start by making a discord application. 

* Firstly, go to the [Discord Developer Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and press New Application in the top right. 

* Give the application a name (this is what Discord will say you are "playing"). Don't worry about this too much, it can always be changed. 

* Once on this page find the APPLICATION ID under general information, copy it and input it to the GUI after pressing the input Client ID button. 

* Go back to the developer dashboard and click on Rich Presence -> Art Assets

* Here, upload any images you want to have show up on your rich presence status. 

* Finally, return to Discord Custom Rich Presencee Client and press update presence. 

* Input all relevant information and when you press OK it should now show up as your Discord status.

The visualizer on the developer dashboard is very helpful in rendering what the status will look like on Discord. It's a good idea to create the status there and then copy the fields into the Client. Make sure the image keys are exact.
